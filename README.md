# MoodRing.me

[Mood Ring](https://moodring.me) is a mobile-first web app that determines a user's mood based on their recently played music on Spotify. There is also a demo available for users without a Spotify account.

This project was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/), [the Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), [Spotify OAuth2](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/), and designed with [Figma](http://figma.com). It's also hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

The backend for the project, built with NestJS, can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dunleavyjack/moodring.me-backend).
